# garbage-collector
garbage-collector with C

## Memory Management Understanding
You will gain a deep understanding of memory management concepts, including dynamic memory allocation and deallocation. This includes knowledge of the heap, stack, and how memory is allocated for variables.

## C Programming Skills
The project will enhance your C programming skills. You'll work closely with pointers, structures, and various data structures to implement your memory management system.

## Algorithmic Thinking
Designing an efficient malloc and garbage collector involves algorithmic thinking. You'll need to consider factors like fragmentation, allocation strategy, and garbage collection algorithms.

## Debugging and Profiling
As you work on your memory management system, you'll likely encounter bugs and performance issues. This project will help you develop skills in debugging and profiling C code to identify and address these issues.

## Low-Level System Understanding
Building a memory allocator requires a deep understanding of how memory is managed at a low level in a system. You'll become familiar with concepts like memory pages, alignment, and system calls related to memory management.

## Performance Optimization
Optimizing the performance of your memory management system is crucial. This will involve profiling your code, analyzing bottlenecks, and implementing improvements for efficiency.

## Testing and Validation
Developing a robust malloc and garbage collector requires thorough testing. You'll learn how to create test cases, validate your implementation, and ensure it behaves correctly under various scenarios.

## Documentation
Documenting your code and design decisions is an important skill. It helps others understand your work and facilitates future maintenance.

## Understanding Garbage Collection Techniques
Implementing a garbage collector involves understanding various garbage collection techniques, such as reference counting, mark-and-sweep, or generational garbage collection. You'll gain insights into the pros and cons of each approach.

## Project Management
Depending on the scope of your project, you might also develop project management skills. Breaking down the task into manageable parts, setting goals, and meeting deadlines are valuable skills in any software development project.

Overall, garbage collector project in C is a hands-on way to deepen your understanding of memory management and low-level programming while honing various practical programming and debugging skills.
